# ðŸ’¬ LazyChat
I made this project to demo how we can combine Angular, Python, and Socket IO to create a real-time chat application with features such as:

- Online status updates (As one of your friends connect their online status is updated instantly via SocketIO)
- The ability to search for someone on lazy chat via their email (Search suggestions are shown as you type the first two letters)
- The ability to unfriend someone
- The ability to delete messages sent by you (Only the sender of the message can delete a message, hence you cannot delete messages sent by your friend)
- Builtin JWT Authentication (Settings for tokens can be easily adjusted)
- Users are notified when:
  - Messages are deleted
  - Someone is unfriended
- There are also template checks for a selected friend, messages, etc.

#### Dashboard - Gray dot turns green to show that your friend is logged in.
The socket is configured to only notify a user friends that he/she is online/offline and does not broadcast the online status to every member of LazyChat.

#### Dashboard - If new messages are sent from a friend...
if the user is engaged with another user a badge notification is shown with the number of messages send from a friend. These badge notifications are automatically cleared when the user reads the messages received from the respective friend.
