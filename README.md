# LazyChat
I made this project to demo how we can combine Angular, Python and Socket IO to create a realtime chat application with features such as:

- Online status updates (As on of your friends connect their online status is updated instantly via SocketIO)
- The ability to search for someone on lazy chat via their email (Search suggestions are shown as you type the first two letters)
- The ability to unfriend someone
- The ability to delete messages send by you (Only the sender of the message can delete a message, hence you cannot delete messages sent by your friend)
- Builtin JWT Authentication (Settings for tokens can be easily adjusted)
- Users are notified when
  - Messages are deleted
  - Someone is unfriended
- There are also template checks for selected friend, messages etc.
